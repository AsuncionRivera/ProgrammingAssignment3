## The code book describes all variables and units

The site where the full description is available is http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The data for the project is https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The zip file contains 2 folders namely test and train and 4 tables namely activity_labels.txt, features.txt, features_info.txt, and README.txt
The test folder contains another folder namely Inertial Signals and 3 tables namely subject_test.txt, X_test.txt, and y_test.txt
The Inertial Signals folder contains 9 tables namely body_acc__x_test.txt, body_acc__y_test.txt, body_acc__z_test.txt,
                                                      body_gyro__x_test.txt, body_gyro__y_test.txt, body_gyro__z_test.txt
                                                      total_acc__x_test.txt, total_acc__y_test.txt, total_acc__z_test.txt
The train folder contains another folder namely Inertial Signals and 3 tables namely subject_train.txt, X_train.txt, and y_train.txt
The Inertial Signals folder contains 9 tables namely body_acc__x_train.txt, body_acc__y_train.txt, body_acc__z_train.txt,
                                                      body_gyro__x_train.txt, body_gyro__y_train.txt, body_gyro__z_train.txt
                                                      total_acc__x_train.txt, total_acc__y_train.txt, total_acc__z_train.txt
There are 6 activities namely
  - Walking
  - Walking Upstairs
  - Walking Downstairs
  - Sitting
  - Standing
  - Laying

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean
  
run_analysis.R performs the following:
1. Merges the training and test sets to create one data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
